# ðŸ§  SOC Lab â€“ Network Configuration

In this project, I built a virtual network using VMware with **pfSense** as the main firewall.

## ðŸ§© Topology
- pfSense (router/firewall)
- Windows 10 (client)
- Ubuntu Server
- Kali Linux (attacker)

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Simulate a SOC environment for monitoring and network traffic analysis.

## ðŸ§° Tools Used
- pfSense
- Wireshark
- Wazuh

## ðŸ§¾ Result
The setup successfully allowed communication between all machines, and traffic was monitored through pfSense and Wazuh.
