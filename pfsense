I’ve just enhanced my SOC home lab by integrating Suricata and Snort as IDS/IPS solutions to boost network visibility and intrusion prevention.

What I did:

Deployed Suricata for deep packet inspection (HTTP, TLS, DNS).

Configured Snort in IPS mode to block malicious traffic in real time.

Integrated network alerts into Wazuh and used pfSense for traffic mirroring and monitoring.

Expected outcome:
✅ Stronger detection of network-based threats.
✅ Better correlation between host and network data.
✅ Faster response time during incidents.

Next step: fine-tuning custom Suricata and Snort rules for improved accuracy. 👨‍💻
